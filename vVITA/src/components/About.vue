<h3>History</h3>

Devolli Group, based in Peja, started processing VITA milk on November 19, 2003. VITA milk is the result of several years of fruitful cooperation between Devolli Group and the multinational firm Tetra Pak.
VITA is the first milk in Kosovo, processed with the most modern UHT technology (at ultra high temperature) and packaged with Tetra Pak packaging.
Passing through the UHT system, the milk retains for a long time the freshness and nutrition for which VITA is already known everywhere.
